    "content": "The Biden administration’s recently announced restrictions on travelers from India are unlikely to play a significant role in limiting new coronavirus cases in the U.S., Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Friday.Will it have an impact? Perhaps a minor impact on the margins in terms of reducing introductions. It’s not going to dramatically affect our trajectory at this point,  the former Food and Drug Administration commissioner said on  Closing Bell.    It’s probably going to do more harm to India than any good that it attributes to us.  Gottlieb, who sits on the board of Covid vaccine maker Pfizer, said he thinks the White House’s primary rationale for restricting travel from India is concern over the coronavirus variant known as B.1.617. It was first detected in the country and is believed to be highly contagious.But that variant is here anyway and the best way to reduce the risk of that variant is, frankly, to get more Americans vaccinated,  said Gottlieb, who led the FDA in the Trump administration from 2017 to 2019.  That’s going to be the best backstop against the spread of that variant, not restricting travel at this point. White House press secretary Jen Psaki earlier Friday announced the travel restrictions, which go into effect Tuesday. India has been experiencing a major surge of Covid cases in recent weeks, straining its health-care system as daily death counts hit new records.The travel order is expected to apply to non-U.S. citizens or permanent residents who have recently been in India, according to a person familiar with the matter. That means the restrictions will take a similar format to those that been implemented on much travel to the U.S. from China, Brazil and the European Union, effectively barring most visitors from India to the U.S.There are some studies that show when you implement travel restrictions — and most of the studies that have been done have looked at this in the context of an influenza pandemic — that you can delay introduction of a virus into a new region, that you slow the introduction and maybe reduce the peak of the epidemic that another country is going to experience,  Gottlieb said.",
